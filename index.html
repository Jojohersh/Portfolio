                <p>Hello! I'm Jordan, a software developer located in Indianapolis, Indiana. I like interesting challenges, thoughtful design, and long walks on the beach.</p>
    
                <p>I have been descirbed as resourceful, tenacious, and thoughtful. I like a challenge, and I don't like to give up until I've not only found a solution, but understand the core of the issue itself.</p>
    
                <p>I first got a taste of software development in high school using the lovely visual basic language. Seeing my ideas convey to the screen felt like magic, and I was instantly hooked. I then attended Purdue University for a few years studying computer science. </p>
    
                <p>While at Purdue I attended I was introduced to the core concepts of computer science, learning object oriented programming in Java and lower level programming in C and Assembly. I worked as a software development intern at GE Aviation for 6 months where I redesigned the onboarding page for incoming interns to increase usability, developed test cases for software, and helped discover an authentication vulnerability in an internal tool.</p>
    
                <p>Life has taken me many places from software intern to a barista competing on a national stage, to being a staff trainer for the Department of Revenue talking about semi trucks. One constant through all this change was utilizing programming to solve problems. I continued developing applications periodically in my free time over the past couple years, but really wanted a more structured approach to continue my education. With attending college not a financial option, I enrolled in the 6 month Software Development bootcamp through <a href="https://www.elevenfifty.org/">Eleven Fifty Academy</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Through Eleven Fifty I learned how to write full stack applications in C# using the Dotnet Framework, SQL, and Docker. Through group projects I was able to learn and apply Agile methodologies, managing sprints and requirements with Jira, as well as implementing version control methodologies using Git and Github.</p>
    
                <p>When not making neat stuff, I like playing the guitar and drums, playing video games with my friends, running Dungeons and Dragons games, and hanging out with my cats (Nooch and Tofu) and my puppy (Benedict).</p>
